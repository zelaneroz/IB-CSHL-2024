# IB Extended Essay (EE) on Computer Science (M24)

This repository contains all of my notes, code files, data, and drafts of my Extended Essay (EE) on Computer Science submitted to the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO) in May 2024. The EE is a 4000-word research paper that is a mandatory requirement for all IB Diploma Programme students.

The final version of my EE was graded an **A (31/34 marks)**. Both the drafts and the final version to show the progression of my research and writing over the course of the academic year and to serve as a comparison point and reference for IB students pursuing their own CS EEs  (research design, what to and not to include, how to structure their paper, how to present data, etc). 

For further questions or clarifications, please feel free to reach out to me at [zeespanto@gmail.com](mailto:zeespanto@gmail.com).

## About
**Topic**: A comparison of stochastic and deterministic approaches for EEG signal
denoising

**Research Question**: How does a stochastic algorithm (Independent Component Analysis) compare to
a deterministic iterative algorithm (Empirical Mode Decomposition) in
removing artifacts in simulated EEG time series data?

**Additional Keywords and Phrases**: electroencephalogram, timeseries, denoising



## Directory
**[ee.ipynb](ee.ipynb)** contains all of my EE notes/paper annotations + snippets of code trying to work out that certain paper's dataset & content.

**[Espanto_CS_EE_M24.pdf](Espanto_CS_EE_M24.pdf)** is the final version of my EE.

**[CSEE_Draft_m24.pdf](CSEE_Draft_m24.pdf)** was the first draft of my EE submitted internally to my Computer Science EE supervisor during the start of 12th Grade (Sep 2023).
