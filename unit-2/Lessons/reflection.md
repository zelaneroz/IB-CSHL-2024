# Unit 1 Reflection


### What worked well during unit 1?
I really like that we have a Learning Log where we can keep track of assessments and lessons. It was helpful since for most subjects, we had to scramble through tons of links, and having this learning log as a one stop shop for links, was quite helpful.

### What did not work well?
Since I entered the class a month late, I was quite confused with the tasks to do and was initially confused with the logistics of the class. While the email containing the lesson log & instructions for creating a repo was helpful, I still had to ask my friends who also take Computer Science what to access, where to access what, and the expectations. I think that directions could have been more clearer. Example, I was not aware that I had to do Task 1, so Lison and I did not do it and eventually got no marks for it. More office hours would also probably be helpful because it's hard to catch Dr. Ruben's free sched. 

### What did you enjoy the most during project unit 1
I enjoyed that I had complete independence and creative directive during my project. I really loved that we were able to set success criterions of our own so that our projects would be somehow different from each other and that it was up to us on how hard or easy we want our project to be. One could make a crypto to currency calculator or even make the code graph the sheet's balance trend; with the project, creativity was not limited, only time & skill.

### What talent you have discovered or practiced during this unit?
Because of the creative freedome we got from this unit and the fact that we were actually making something tangible, something a real human/user would actually use. Because of this, I kind of figured that I perhaps like the "creating" side of Computer Science, isntead of the competitive/fast programming side of it. Since I used to be so into the arts, specifically painting and a bit of gfx, indulging to this side of Computer Science simply made sense.

### What is working well in Computer Science for you?
I think so far, everything is working well in Computer Science. I think I can say this because I have prior experience or that I have taken Computer Science in school before. However, I personally think that if I did not have this sort of advantage, I would probably struggle with keeping up.

### What can Dr. Ruben do better to support you during Unit 2?
I'm not exactly sure what's in store for Unit 2 but I think providing more notes/slides/sources to learn from would be quite helpful.
