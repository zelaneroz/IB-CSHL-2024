## B. How many different colors could you represent in a 6 bit computer?
$(2^6)^3=(64)^3=262,144$

**Why it's raised to the power of three?**

<cite>The RGB colorspace is used for computer displays. So for 6-bit computers, the final image you see on the screen is a composite of one of 64 (2^6) shades each of red, blue, and green. [^1]</cite>

*RGB(64,64,64)*
