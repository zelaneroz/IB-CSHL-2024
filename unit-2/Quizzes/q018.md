# Quiz 18
Lily was crossing a forest when she realizes that there is a tiger ahead of her who has seen Lily.  Lily quickly takes out a matchbox from her bag and burns a matchstick, because the tiger is afraid of fire . 

A matchstick takes 5 seconds to burn completely.
The length of the forest that Lily needs to cross is **l meters**.
Lily's speed is **s cm/s**.

what is the minimum number of matchsticks Lily needs to burn to cross the forest safely.


## Code
```
def numberMatches(l:int,s:int)->int:
    return l*100/s/5
```

## Proof
Note: I wanted to put "matches" along with the return values but I'd have str as the return type; the quiz states the function outputs an int type

## Truth Table

Create the truth table for the boolean equation: $\text{out}=ABC+(A+B+C)+\overline{(\overline{ABC})}$

| $A$ | $B$ | $C$ | $ABC$ | $A+B+C$ | $\overline{A}$ | $\overline{B}$ | $\overline{C}$ | $\overline{ABC}$ | $\overline{\overline{ABC}}$ | $ABC+(A+B+C)$ | $\text{out} = ABC+(A+B+C)+\overline{\overline{ABC}}$ |
