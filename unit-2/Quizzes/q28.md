# Quiz 28

## A. Data & Instructions
Create a graph for the x, y data below: 

data =  {'x': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19],
'y': [24, 1, 2, 25, 26, 21, 23, 34, 49, 2, 19, 32, 7, 17, 36, 7, 45, 28, 40, 46]}

Add a the item “title”:“quiz028” to the dictionary.




### Code
```.py
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import warnings
import numpy as np
warnings.simplefilter('ignore')

data = {'x':[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19],
        'y':[24,1,2,25,26,21,23,34,49,2,19,32,7,17,36,7,45,28,40,46]}

data['title']="quiz028"
plt.plot(data['x'],data['y'])
plt.ylabel('Y')
plt.xlabel('X')
plt.title(data['title'])
plt.show()
```

## B. Convert the following rgb color to hex color.
* red = 10
* green = 255
* blue = 255

**Scheme**: Divide the first figure by 16. The quotient is the Hex Code in the tens place. Multiply the remainder of the previous operation by 16; this is the hex code for the ones place of that certain pair.

1. 10: (10//16) = 0; (10%16)=10 

  *10 is equivalent to A* Thus, it's 0A.

2. 255: (255//16)=15; (255%16)=15; 

  *15 is equivalent to F; 10 is equivalent to A.* Thus, it's FF.

3. 255: (255//16)=15; (255%16)=15; 

  *15 is equivalent to F; 10 is equivalent to A.* Thus, it's FF.


When combined, it's #0AFAFA


**Answer**: #0AFFFF or $0AFFFF_{16}$
