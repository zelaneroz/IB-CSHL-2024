# Quiz 30

## A. Smoothing
Using the data in the learning Log (Item 21), create a graph with a smoothed version where the smoothing window is every 4 points.

```.py
h = [57.0, 56.0, 57.0, 56.0, 55.0, 55.0, 54.0, 54.0, 54.0, 53.0, 53.0, 54.0, 53.0, 53.0, 52.0, 52.0, 51.0, 51.0, 51.0, 50.0, 50.0, 49.0, 50.0, 49.0, 49.0, 48.0, 49.0, 49.0, 48.0, 48.0, 48.0, 49.0]
```

### Code
```.py
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import warnings
import numpy as np
warnings.simplefilter('ignore')

#RAW
h = [57.0, 56.0, 57.0, 56.0, 55.0, 55.0, 54.0, 54.0, 54.0, 53.0, 53.0, 54.0, 53.0, 53.0, 52.0, 52.0, 51.0, 51.0, 51.0, 50.0, 50.0, 49.0, 50.0, 49.0, 49.0, 48.0, 49.0, 49.0, 48.0, 48.0, 48.0, 49.0]

#SMOOTHING FUNCTION
def smoothing(data,window_size):
    mean_per_sample = []
    for t in range(0,len(data), window_size):
        t_hour = data[t:t+window_size] #4 values
        mean_per_sample.append(sum(t_hour)/len(t_hour))
    return mean_per_sample

#PLOTS
fig, ax = plt.subplots(3,1, figsize=(8, 6))
data,titles=[h,smoothing(h,4),smoothing(h,2)],['Raw Humidity Data','Smoothed Humidity Data (window size=4)','Smoothed Humidity Data (Window overlaps by 50%)']
for i in range(3):
    ax[i].plot(data[i])
    ax[i].set_title(titles[i])
    ax[i].set_xlabel('Samples')
    ax[i].set_ylabel('Relative Humidity (%)')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## B. When was the internet first created? Remember to add your sources
The birth of the internet is widely considered to be Jan. 1, 1983, but the vision started decades before[^1]. The concept of data communication – transmitting data between two different places through an electromagnetic medium – pre-dates the introduction of the first computers. Even as far as 1960s, Nikola Tesla had the idea of a world wireless system[^2]. The issue of connecting separate physical networks to form one logical network was the first of many problems. Thus, inventors like Paul Baran[^3] and Paul Davis started to create innovations such as a a local area network based on packet switching[^4], to help mend this problem.

Following the creation of packet switching, ARPANET arose from a desire to share information over great distances without the need for dedicated phone connections between each computer on a network - an idea based on J.C.R Licklider's interests[^5]. Robert Taylor of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and Larry Roberts from MIT started to realize this idea in January 1967 through The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET). ARPANET's main use was for academic and research purposes as seen from its first use - a link between UCLA's Engineering Department and Stanford Research Institute[^6]. ARPANET is widely considered to be the first working prototype of the internet.

ARPANET was eventually dissolved but it paved the way for more network schemes to be invented. Several other branches of the U.S. government, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Science Foundation (NSF), and the Department of Energy (DOE) became heavily involved in Internet research and started development of a successor to ARPANET. In the mid-1980s, all three of these branches developed the first Wide Area Networks based on TCP/IP. [^7]. ARPANET's adaptation of TCP-IP marked the widely known birthdate of the internet, Jan. 1, 1983. 

From hereon, researchers began to assemble the “network of networks” that became the modern Internet. The online world then took on a more recognizable form in 1990, when computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee, while he was working at CERN, invented the World Wide Web. While it’s often confused with the internet itself, the web is actually just the most common means of accessing data online in the form of websites and hyperlinks[^2].
