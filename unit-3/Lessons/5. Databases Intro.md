# 2. Working with SQL Lite
SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases.

**In Pycharm**
1. View > Databases > '+' > Data Source > SQLite
2. To open console: '+' > Query Console; OR Shift+Command+L

## Basic Syntax
- Use CMD+Enter, don't use the typical 'Run'
- line ends with ``` ; ```
- To comment: ``` -- this is a comment ```

**Create Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE student{
    
    }
```

**Select**
'*' means everything
student is the name of the object
```sql
Select * from student;
SELECT count(*) from student;
```

**Select Unique**
```sql
SELECT distinct email from student;
```

**Organizing in Order**
* ```DESC``` - Descending
```sql
SELECT * from student order by age;
SELECT * from student order by age DESC
```



## Tips
- It's a good idea to have ```create table if not exists``` so that you won't create multiple tables and overload the database.
